This code is the product of work carried out in the group of Paula Croxson at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. If you find our code helpful to your work, consider giving us a shout-out in your publications:

Froudist-Walsh, Browning, Young, Murphy, Mars, Fleysher and Croxson, "Macro-connectomics and microstructure predict dynamic plasticity patterns in the non-human primate brain", eLife, 2018. Note that raw imaging data will be uploaded to PRIME-DE (Milham et al., Neuron, 2018) upon publication.

Notes with code:

Runs in Matlab (tested on version 2016a for Mac)
Note that the Matlab toolboxes and functions should all be in the Matlab path
